// checks.test.mjs pins the two run SELECTIONS against checks.mjs. That is not
// enough on its own: #1047 and #1052 stalled because the step around a correct
// selection stopped when the selection was empty, reported "the panel will
// engage on the next CI run", and there was no next CI run. What follows drives
// the whole step against a stubbed github-script context, one scenario per arm,
// so a future edit that re-introduces a silent no-op fails here rather than on a
// PR nobody notices has stopped.
//
// The step is read out of the YAML rather than re-typed, for the reason the
// mirror test already gives: a hand copy can only prove this file agrees with
// itself.
