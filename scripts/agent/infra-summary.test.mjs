// round tries to re-verify it, the verifier (biased to keep) cannot refute it on
// grounded evidence, and the loop sticks — one round later, on whatever pull
// request next hits a quota error. That is a long way from the edit that caused it.
//
// These tests are the thing that makes the string safe to refactor.
