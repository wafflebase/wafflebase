# Lessons

- Keep `CLAUDE.md` high-signal: prefer stable project constraints, commands, and hard-earned pitfalls over long file indexes.
- When a guideline doc already has an index (`design/README.md`), link to that index instead of duplicating long per-file summaries.
- If a recurring mistake appears in task-local lessons (for example commit body `\n` handling), promote it to `CLAUDE.md` so it is visible every session.
