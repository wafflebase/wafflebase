# Lessons

- Prefer additive command aliases when simplifying workflows so existing lane
  contracts remain backward-compatible.
- Keep prerequisite docs focused on one-time runtime requirements instead of
  dependency installation commands already covered by `pnpm install`.
- Keep root README verify explanations command-first and avoid long per-lane
  prose when a short quick-guide bullet list is enough.
