# Comment Mentions — Todo

Implements `@user` mentions in comments (mention-only; notifications
deferred). Design: `docs/design/comments-mentions.md`. Continuation of the
`docs-comments-followup` roadmap Step 4 (the `+ notifications` half stays
deferred).

Scope decisions (locked in brainstorming):

- Mention-only: input + storage + render. No notification infra.
- Storage: inline `@[username](userId)` token in the existing plain-string
  `Comment.body`. No CRDT/type change.
- Tokenize on submit (approach B) + view-local mention map; manual edit of a
  mention drops it to plain text gracefully.
- Mentionable set = workspace members via existing `GET /workspaces/:id`
  (no new backend).
- Chip click = no-op for now; hover tooltip shows username + photo.
- Lands in the shared module → sheets + docs both get it; slides inherits.

## Tasks

### 1. Pure helpers — `components/comments/mentions.ts` ✅
- [x] `parseMentionBody(body): BodySegment[]` (text / mention segments).
- [x] `serializeMention({userId, username})` → `@[username](userId)`;
  strip `]` from username and `)` from userId.
- [x] `extractMentionedUserIds(body): string[]` (future notification hook).
- [x] `mentions.test.ts` — round-trip, `@[` in prose, names with `]`/`)`,
  adjacent mentions, start/end, empty body. 14 tests pass.

### 2. Member source — `useWorkspaceMembers(workspaceId)` ✅
- [x] Hook reading `GET /workspaces/:id` (existing `fetchWorkspace`) →
  `{userId, username, photo}[]` via tanstack `useQuery` (5-min staleTime,
  shared cache key). No new request type / endpoint.
- [x] Threaded members from the views (docs: `docs-detail` → `DocsView` new
  `workspaceId` prop → popover + new-thread composer; sheets: `sheet-view`
  already had `workspaceId` → `CommentPopover`) into `CommentComposer`.
  Anonymous/share-link (`shared-document`, read-only) → empty list, dropdown
  disabled, existing chips still render.

### 3. Input — mention autocomplete in `CommentComposer` ✅
- [x] `@`-trigger detection via `detectMentionQuery` (start-of-text or
  whitespace before `@`; stops at whitespace; ignores `email@host`).
- [x] Member dropdown (`role=listbox`/`option`) reusing `AuthorAvatar`;
  username case-insensitive substring match, capped at 8.
- [x] Keyboard ↑/↓/Enter/Tab/Esc intercepted **only when open**;
  Cmd/Ctrl+Enter submit + Esc-cancel preserved (Cmd+Enter falls through
  even with dropdown open).
- [x] Mention map (`selectedRef`) records `{userId, username}` on select;
  textarea shows clean `@username `; `onMouseDown` keeps focus.
- [x] On submit, `applySelectedMentions` rewrites still-matching
  `@username` → token (longest-first, boundary lookahead); edited mentions
  drop to plain text.
- [x] IME: `compositionstart`/`compositionend` suppress trigger/keys.
- [x] 27 helper unit tests + 5 composer interaction tests pass.

### 4. Render — `CommentBody` in `CommentThreadCard` ✅
- [x] Replace plain-text body output with `CommentBody`.
- [x] Text segments verbatim (whitespace/newlines preserved).
- [x] Mention chip: blue, `title` tooltip (username), click no-op. Photo
  enrichment deferred (token carries username+userId only; parse-only
  render works for anonymous viewers).
- [x] Used by both sheets + docs thread cards (shared component).
- [x] Side-panel snippet + OrphanedCard preview use `mentionBodyToPlainText`
  so the raw token never leaks into truncated previews.

### 5. Tests + verification
- [x] Composer interaction test (`.test.ts` + `IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT`):
  `@` opens dropdown, filter, keyboard select, tokenized submit, edit→drop,
  edit-entry round-trip.
- [x] `CommentBody` render test (chips + plain text).
- [x] `pnpm verify:fast` green (EXIT=0 across all lanes).
- [ ] Manual smoke in `pnpm dev`: mention in docs + sheets comment, Korean
  IME path, chip render + tooltip. **(pending — needs running app)**

### 6. Wrap-up
- [x] Self code-review over full branch diff (subagent). Findings applied:
  edit round-trip (blocking), CJK trigger boundary, shared query cache.
  Reviewer #2 (CJK-username boundary) confirmed non-issue — usernames are
  ASCII GitHub logins.
- [x] Capture lessons in `20260621-comments-mentions-lessons.md`.
- [ ] `pnpm tasks:archive && pnpm tasks:index`; PR (Summary + Test plan).
  **(pending — after manual smoke + user go-ahead)**

## Review

Shipped mention-only (input + storage + render) across the shared comments
module, live for sheets + docs (slides inherits when its comments land).
Commits on `feat/comments-mentions`:

1. `mentions.ts` token helpers + design/task docs.
2. `CommentBody` chip render + `mentionBodyToPlainText` previews.
3. `@` autocomplete composer + `useWorkspaceMembers` + view wiring.
4. Self-review fixes (edit round-trip, CJK trigger, shared cache).

No CRDT/`@wafflebase/*` type change. 59 comments tests; `verify:fast` green.
Deferred: notifications (Step 4 remainder), photo-in-chip tooltip, the
docs-comments visual harness scenarios (separate todo).

## Out of scope (tracked elsewhere)
- Notifications (in-app + email) — `docs-comments-followup` Step 4 remainder.
- Slides comments (mentions inherited once they exist).
- Mentioning non-members / mention-to-share.
