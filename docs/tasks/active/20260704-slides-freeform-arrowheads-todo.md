# Slides — Freeform (custGeom) line-end arrowheads

## Problem

PPTX freeform shapes (`<p:sp>` + `<a:custGeom>`) can carry line-end
arrowheads on their `<a:ln>` (`<a:headEnd>` / `<a:tailEnd>`), exactly like
connectors. Wafflebase drops them entirely:

- Import: `buildFreeformElement()` (`import/pptx/shape.ts`) reads only
  `fill` + `stroke`; `headEnd`/`tailEnd` are ignored.
- Model: `ShapeElement.data` has no `arrowheads` field.
- Render: `shape-renderer.ts` / `shapes/freeform.ts` never draw arrowheads.

Repro: the shared "Yorkie 실시간 동시 편집 적용하기" deck, slide 10
("Local First Remote Later"). The teal (`accent5`) and orange (`FFAB40`)
curves around the "Asynchronous" cloud are freeform cubic-bezier shapes
with `<a:tailEnd type="triangle" len="med" w="med"/>`; their arrow tips
are missing in Wafflebase (present in Keynote/Google Slides). Slide 5's
`<p:cxnSp>` connectors are unaffected — they already render arrowheads.

## Goal

Import, model, render, and export line-end arrowheads for `freeform`
shapes, reusing the existing connector arrowhead primitives
(`parseArrowhead`, `drawArrowhead`, export `arrowXml`). No behaviour
change for connectors or parametric shapes.

## Plan (TDD — failing test first for each layer)

- [x] Model: add `arrowheads?: { start?: ArrowheadStyle; end?: ArrowheadStyle }`
      to `ShapeElement.data` (`import type { ArrowheadStyle } from './connector'`).
- [x] Import: `buildFreeformElement` parses `<a:ln>` `headEnd`/`tailEnd`
      via `parseArrowhead`; only sets `data.arrowheads` when start or end present.
- [x] Render: in `drawShape` freeform branch, after `paintFillStroke`,
      compute the path start/end tip + tangent (in scaled local coords) and
      call `drawArrowhead` with the resolved stroke color. Tangent mirrors
      `connector-renderer`'s `endpointPose` (reverse at start).
- [x] Export: `shapeToXml` freeform `<a:ln>` emits `headEnd`/`tailEnd`;
      reuse/export `arrowXml` from `export/pptx/connector.ts`; extend
      `lineXml` to accept optional arrowheads.
- [x] Round-trip: freeform + tailEnd triangle survives export→import.
- [x] `pnpm verify:fast` green (EXIT=0). Real deck slide 10 re-parsed:
      ≥2 freeform shapes now carry an end triangle arrowhead (throwaway test).
- [ ] Manual smoke on slide 10 via `pnpm dev` (re-upload the .pptx — the
      already-stored shared doc won't re-import). Left for merge time.
- [x] Address code-review findings (high, workflow-backed).

## Review (code-review: high, 5 findings)

- **Arrowheads dropped on export without a stroke** (correctness) — fixed at
  import: only attach `arrowheads` when a stroke is present, so import /
  render / export all gate on stroke symmetrically.
- **Stray arrowheads on closed (`Z`) freeforms** (correctness) — fixed at
  import: skip arrowheads when the path is closed (a loop has no open ends,
  matching PowerPoint). Test added.
- **Arc endpoint tangent used the chord** (correctness) — replaced with the
  true ellipse tangent `dP/dθ = (−rx·sinθ·w, ry·cosθ·h)`, sweep-sign aware.
  Test added (quarter arc → base at x≈62, not the 135° chord).
- **`lineXml` called for all kinds** (cleanup) — guard so only `freeform`
  passes `arrowheads` to export.
- **Duplicated bezier-tangent logic** (cleanup) — *declined*: unifying with
  `connector-renderer`'s `endpointPose` would mean rewriting the stable
  connector path (different data shape: `BezierPath` vs command walk); the
  shared essence is a 3-line `atan2` fallback. Net risk > value.

Verification: `pnpm verify:fast` EXIT=0 (lint + typecheck + all unit tests;
slides +3 tests). Real deck `slide10.xml` re-parse confirmed ≥2 freeform
shapes now carry an end triangle arrowhead.

### Review round 2 (post smoke test — code-review: high, 4 findings + 1 refuted)

- **Compound / multi-subpath freeform** (correctness, 2 findings) — the
  import "open" check only looked at the last command and the renderer
  anchored the start arrowhead to the first `M` regardless of subpath, so a
  freeform with >1 subpath could drop (import) or misplace (render) tips.
  Fixed by gating arrowheads to a **single open subpath** (exactly one `M`,
  no trailing `Z`); compound arrowed freeforms are a documented best-effort
  limitation (dropped, not misplaced). Test added.
- **Inline arrowhead-pair type duplicated** (cleanup) — extracted
  `ArrowheadPair` in `model/connector.ts`, used by both `ConnectorElement`
  and freeform `ShapeElement.data`.
- **Duplicated endpoint-tangent logic** (cleanup) — *declined again*: same
  reasoning (unifying means rewriting the stable connector `endpointPose`
  path, different data shape). Non-blocking.
- **`Pt` vs `Point`** — refuted by the verifier; left as the local helper type.

Verification: `pnpm verify:fast` EXIT=0 (slides +1 test = 2469 pass).

## Notes / decisions

- Arrowhead size stays the fixed `sm/md/lg` (8/12/18px) model shared with
  connectors — the separate "fixed vs line-width-proportional sizing"
  question (slide 5) is out of scope here.
- Closed paths (`Z`) with arrowheads are unusual; draw at the raw
  first/last anchors regardless (matches OOXML semantics; deck shapes are open).
- Arc (`A`) end tangent falls back to chord direction; deck curves are cubic.
