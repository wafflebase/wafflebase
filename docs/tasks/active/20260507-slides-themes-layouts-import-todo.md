## PR3 — Customize the theme

User value: brand-fit edits without leaving the editor.

Re-reviewed 2026-06-25 against current code; commit plan regrounded (see
design doc "Re-review" subsection). Key finding: theme/master colors and
fonts already cascade via render-time role resolution (repaint only), but
background fill was NOT rendered with inheritance, and layout placeholder
**positions** and master placeholder **type-styles** are copied/seeded at
slide-creation and need an explicit cascade.

Decisions (2026-06-25, user-confirmed): (1) background — wire renderer
precedence slide→layout→master→theme (proper inheritance); (2) cascade —
smart: layout position re-flows a slide placeholder only when its frame
still matches the pre-edit layout frame (user-moved placeholders kept);
master type-style re-seeds only empty placeholders (typed text kept).
Plan re-split into 5 commits for reviewability.

- [x] commit 1 — `feat(slides): updateTheme/updateMaster/updateLayout store mutations`
- [x] commit 2 — `feat(slides): background fill/image inheritance (slide→layout→master)`
- [x] commit 3 — `feat(slides): cascade layout geometry + master placeholder styles`
- [ ] commit 4 — `feat(slides): theme builder mode + layouts/master thumbnail panel`
- [ ] commit 5 — `feat(frontend): theme builder UI shell + editing surface`
- [ ] verify: theme/master color edit repaints all slides <100 ms (role-resolved)
- [ ] verify: master/layout background edit cascades to inheriting slides on repaint
- [ ] verify: layout placeholder position edit re-flows only slides on that layout; user-moved/added elements untouched
- [ ] verify: master placeholder font-size edit picks up on unmodified placeholders only
- [ ] verify: each edit + cascade is a single undo unit
- [ ] verify: two-user Yorkie concurrent master + slide edit convergence
- [ ] verify: `pnpm verify:browser:docker` covers theme builder entry
- [ ] PR opened, reviewed, merged

## Cross-cutting

- [x] Update `docs/design/README.md` Slides section with new doc
- [x] Capture lessons in paired `20260507-slides-themes-layouts-import-lessons.md`
- [ ] After all three PRs merged: `pnpm tasks:archive && pnpm tasks:index`
